# Tetris
Since Tetris is a very easy-to-make and common python programming game, our goal is to make users can download it through a web page, and get experience of working with partners. We made a web page with html and CSS.
The [web page](https://github.com/bobhaotian/Tetris/blob/e4cc433a4783a7cb588d072bbc98bd83fd369201/Web_page.md) contains a demo and the number of downloads with some instructions. 
## Barriers and Conquering
Problems happened when transfering the .py file to .exe 
- pip installer is not working on my computer
- since Python is not added to Windows path, which means I cannot directly use python -m pip install --upgrade pip
- changing to pip3 but still not working
- upgrading PIP on Windows in Command Prompt 
We found mac doesn't allow unauthorized .dmg file to run, and we found a way to solve it and add it in the instruction.
